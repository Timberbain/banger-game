## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Wall collision blocks movement (all 4 edges)
expected: Move any character into all 4 arena border walls. While touching a wall, press perpendicular directions. Character should stop cleanly and slide along wall without super speed, jitter, or clipping.
result: pass

### 2. Obstacle collision without glitches
expected: Move a character into obstacle tiles (brown/orange/gold). Character should be physically blocked. While touching an obstacle, move perpendicular — should slide cleanly without jitter or speed exploits.
result: pass

### 3. Guardian diagonal wall slide (all 4 edges)
expected: As a guardian (Faran/Baran), run diagonally into each wall edge (left, right, top, bottom). Guardian should stop on the colliding axis and continue sliding along the wall on the other axis — works correctly on ALL 4 edges, not just left/top.
result: pass

### 4. Client prediction matches server (right/bottom walls)
expected: As any character, move along right and bottom walls. No jitter, rubber-banding, or super speed bursts. As Paran near right wall: pressing down should move at normal speed, pressing up should also work normally.
result: pass
