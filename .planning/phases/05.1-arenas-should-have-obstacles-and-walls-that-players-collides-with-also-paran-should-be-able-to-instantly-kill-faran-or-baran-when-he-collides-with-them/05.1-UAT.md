[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Wall collision blocks movement
expected: Move any character into arena border walls. The character should stop and cannot pass through the walls. Try all four edges.
result: issue
reported: "The player stops when hitting wall, but when touching a wall and move in a different direction the collision check freaks out. For example, paran gets super speed. Also players can flicker and jitter through walls."
severity: major

### 2. Obstacle collision blocks movement
expected: Move a character into one of the colored obstacle tiles (brown/orange/gold blocks visible on the map). The character should be physically blocked and cannot walk through them.
result: issue
reported: "same issue, obstacles also cause jitter and speed glitches"
severity: major

### 3. Paran wall penalty - lose all velocity
expected: As Paran, build up speed and run into a wall or obstacle. Paran should instantly lose ALL velocity (comes to a dead stop) rather than just stopping on the colliding axis.
result: pass

### 4. Guardian wall collision - per-axis stop
expected: As a guardian (Faran/Baran), run diagonally into a wall. The guardian should stop only on the axis that hit the wall, continuing to slide along the wall on the other axis.
result: issue
reported: "works for left and top. When hitting bottom and right wall, the character jitters, get superspeed and jumps through walls"
severity: major

### 5. Paran contact kill
expected: As Paran, move into a guardian (Faran or Baran). The guardian should instantly die on body overlap. Paran keeps moving without stopping.
result: pass

### 6. Projectile-wall destruction
expected: Fire a projectile at a wall. The projectile should be destroyed on contact with the wall (disappears), dealing no damage to the wall.
result: pass

### 7. Destructible obstacle takes projectile damage
expected: Fire projectiles at a gold (Light) obstacle. After 2 hits it should be destroyed and disappear, opening the path. Orange (Medium) takes 3 hits, brown (Heavy) takes 5 hits.
result: pass

### 8. Paran instant-breaks destructible obstacles
expected: As Paran, run into any destructible obstacle (gold/orange/brown). It should instantly break regardless of its HP, opening the path. Paran loses all velocity from the collision.
result: pass

### 9. Obstacle visual tiers
expected: Three visually distinct obstacle types are visible on the maps: gold/yellow (Light), orange (Medium), and brown (Heavy). They should look clearly different from each other and from walls.
result: pass

### 10. Client prediction matches server collision
expected: Move around walls and obstacles with your local character. There should be no jitter, wall-clipping, or rubber-banding. The character should smoothly stop at obstacles without snapping.
result: issue
reported: "When colliding with a right wall and then press down, the character gets super speed downwards. If pressing up, character doesnt move"
severity: major

### 11. Destroyed obstacle syncs to all clients
expected: When an obstacle is destroyed (by projectile or Paran contact), all players should see it disappear. The tile should be removed from the map for everyone.
result: pass

### 12. Maps have strategic obstacle layouts
expected: Play on different maps (rotate by playing multiple matches). Each map should have visible destructible obstacles placed strategically in the arena, not just walls.
result: pass
