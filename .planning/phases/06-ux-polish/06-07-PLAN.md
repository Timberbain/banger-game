  <name>Task 1: Visual verification of all Phase 6 UX Polish features</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Human verifies all Phase 6 features in a live game session.

    What was built: Complete UX Polish phase -- pixel art sprites and tilesets, HUD overlay (health/timer/kill feed/cooldown/ping), visual effects (particles, sprite flash, trails, speed lines), audio system (chiptune SFX, music, volume controls), help screen, and solarpunk-themed lobby/boot/victory screens.

    How to verify:
    1. Start the game: `cd server && npm run dev` + `cd client && npm run dev`. Open 3 browser tabs to http://localhost:8080
    2. Boot screen: Verify pixel art "BANGER" title with solarpunk colors. Click to start.
    3. Lobby: Verify solarpunk-themed background, character sprites in selection, "How to Play" button, volume controls, button click sounds.
    4. Help screen: Verify controls guide, all 3 roles with sprites/stats, win conditions, back button.
    5. Start a match (3 tabs: create room, join with code x2).
    6. In-game HUD: Verify timer at top center (5:00), health bars at bottom, ping display, role banner, role reminder.
    7. Pixel art sprites: Verify sprites (not rectangles), walk animations, per-map tilesets, no floating bars/labels.
    8. Combat feedback: Verify shot sounds, sprite flash, particle bursts, projectile trails, cooldown bar, death explosion, kill feed.
    9. Paran-specific: Verify wall impact particles/sound, speed lines at high velocity.
    10. Match timer: Verify red flash in last 30s. Optionally let timer expire for guardian timeout win.
    11. Victory screen: Verify particle effects, color wash, solarpunk styling.
    12. Return to lobby: Verify scene cleanup (no stale data).
