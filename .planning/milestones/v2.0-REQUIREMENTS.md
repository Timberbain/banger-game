# Requirements: Banger v2.0 Arena Evolution

**Defined:** 2026-02-13
**Core Value:** The asymmetric momentum mechanic must feel right -- Paran building terrifying speed with Pac-Man cardinal movement but losing everything on collision, guardians relying on positioning and teamwork to force those collisions.

## v2.0 Requirements

Requirements for v2.0 release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Display & Camera

- [ ] **DISP-01**: Game renders at 1280x720 viewport with pixel art scaling preserved
- [ ] **DISP-02**: Camera follows the local player with smooth deadzone
- [ ] **DISP-03**: Camera respects world bounds (no rendering outside arena)
- [ ] **DISP-04**: All scenes (Boot, Lobby, Victory, Help, HUD) render correctly at 1280x720
- [ ] **DISP-05**: Smooth zoom transition between stages

### Arena & Maps

- [ ] **ARENA-01**: Arenas use the 32x32 topdown tileset spreadsheet for ground tiles, and hedge/brick/wood tilesets for walls and obstacles
- [ ] **ARENA-02**: Arenas are ~50x38 tiles (1600x1216px) with scrollable view
- [ ] **ARENA-03**: Map data uses human-readable JSON format with tile type references
- [ ] **ARENA-04**: Maps define spawn locations for each player role
- [ ] **ARENA-05**: Each arena has a distinct visual theme using different tileset combinations

### Multi-Stage Rounds

- [ ] **ROUND-01**: Match consists of best-of-3 stages (first to win 2 stages wins)
- [ ] **ROUND-02**: Each stage uses a different arena
- [ ] **ROUND-03**: Stage intro screen shows arena name and round number before play begins
- [ ] **ROUND-04**: Smooth transition between stages (score display, next arena load)
- [ ] **ROUND-05**: Round score is displayed throughout the match
- [ ] **ROUND-06**: Winner declared after best-of-3 with final stats

### Powerup System

- [ ] **PWR-01**: Powerups spawn at random positions in the arena during gameplay
- [ ] **PWR-02**: Player collects powerup on contact (server-authoritative)
- [ ] **PWR-03**: Speed boost powerup temporarily increases movement speed
- [ ] **PWR-04**: Invincibility powerup temporarily prevents damage
- [ ] **PWR-05**: Larger hitbox powerup temporarily increases projectile hit area
- [ ] **PWR-06**: Active powerup shown in HUD with remaining duration
- [ ] **PWR-07**: Powerups use potion icon assets for visual representation

### Minimap

- [ ] **MMAP-01**: Semi-transparent minimap overlay shows during gameplay
- [ ] **MMAP-02**: Minimap displays player positions with role-colored markers
- [ ] **MMAP-03**: Minimap shows only players (not full terrain detail)

### Audio

- [ ] **AUD-01**: Lobby plays music from assets/soundtrack/lobby/ on loop
- [ ] **AUD-02**: A random stage track is selected when a new game starts and plays throughout all stages
- [ ] **AUD-03**: Music crossfades between lobby and game transitions; a different track is picked each new game

### HUD & UI

- [ ] **HUD-01**: Health display uses heart icon assets
- [ ] **HUD-02**: Timer uses timer icon asset
- [ ] **HUD-03**: Kill feed uses skull/gravestone icon assets
- [ ] **HUD-04**: Round counter shows current stage progress (e.g., 1-0)
- [ ] **HUD-05**: Powerup indicators show active buff type and duration
- [ ] **HUD-06**: All UI elements properly positioned for 1280x720 viewport

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Gameplay Expansion

- **GAME-01**: Additional powerup types (shield, teleport, slow enemies)
- **GAME-02**: Ranked/competitive matchmaking with ELO
- **GAME-03**: AI bots for practice mode
- **GAME-04**: Spectator mode for watching live matches

### Social

- **SOC-01**: In-game text chat
- **SOC-02**: Player profiles and stats tracking
- **SOC-03**: Account system with persistent progression

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Mobile support | Desktop browser only -- touch controls would need separate UX |
| Voice chat | Players use external communication (Discord, etc.) |
| Procedural map generation | Hand-crafted maps better for competitive balance |
| Local/split-screen multiplayer | Online only architecture |
| Map editor | v2.0 uses human-readable JSON but no visual editor |
| Per-stage music selection | One track per game, randomly selected -- simpler, avoids repetition across stages |
