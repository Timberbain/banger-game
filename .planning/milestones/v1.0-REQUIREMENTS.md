# Requirements: Banger

**Defined:** 2026-02-09
**Core Value:** The asymmetric momentum mechanic must feel right — Paran building speed with instant turning but losing everything on collision, guardians relying on positioning and teamwork to force those collisions.

- [x] **MAP-03**: Obstacles affect Paran navigation (collision penalty zones) — Phase 5.1
- [x] **MAP-04**: Map selection or rotation between matches — Phase 4

### Accounts (Moved to Out of Scope)

- ~~**ACCT-01**: Player can create account with username and password~~ — *Out of Scope: game fully playable without accounts*
- ~~**ACCT-02**: Player session persists across browser refresh~~ — *Out of Scope: reconnection tokens provide sufficient session handling*
- ~~**ACCT-03**: Player stats tracked: wins, losses, games played per character~~ — *Out of Scope: per-match stats exist; persistent tracking deferred*
- ~~**ACCT-04**: Player can view their own stats~~ — *Out of Scope: deferred, no persistent storage in v1.0*

### UX & Polish

**Coverage:**
- v1 requirements: 44 total
- Satisfied: 40
- Out of Scope: 4 (ACCT-01 through ACCT-04)
- Unmapped: 0

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

### Competitive
- **LEAD-01**: Global leaderboards (daily/weekly/all-time)
- **RANK-01**: Skill-based matchmaking with rating system
- **RANK-02**: Ranked competitive mode

### Social
- **COSM-01**: Character cosmetic skins
- **SOCL-01**: Friend system and party queuing
- **CHAT-01**: In-game quick chat wheel

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Local/split-screen multiplayer | Online-only simplifies architecture |
| Mobile touch controls | Desktop browser focus for v1 |
| Voice chat | Toxicity management burden, use external apps |
| Procedural map generation | Hand-crafted maps better for competitive balance |
| Single-player campaign | Arena game, not narrative |
| AI bots | Hard to balance for asymmetric 1v2, human-only |
| NFT/blockchain | Negative community reaction |
| Pay-to-win mechanics | Destroys competitive integrity |
| Account system (ACCT-01-04) | Game fully playable without accounts; reconnection tokens suffice |
