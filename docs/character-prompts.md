## 3. Yellow Death (Force of Nature / Paran-style)

Pixel art character sprite sheet, 48x48 pixels, chibi proportions (large head, small body). The Yellow Death — an ominous hooded plague figure radiating inevitable doom. Tattered yellow-gold burial shrouds draped over the entire body, torn edges fraying and trailing behind like wisps. Deep hood casting the face in shadow. Cracked porcelain white mask covering the face with hollow black eye sockets emitting a faint eerie yellow glow from deep within. Exposed skeletal hands with bony fingers extending from ragged sleeve openings, pale bone-white against the golden wrappings. Wisps of yellow-green toxic miasma trailing off the shoulders and lower body like slow smoke, particles drifting away. No weapons — empty hands held slightly open at the sides in a calm menacing posture, conveying that the character itself is the weapon. Shroud wrappings layered and overlapping with darker amber and burnt gold shadow tones for depth. Slight forward lean as if gliding, feet obscured beneath the dragging burial cloth. Overall silhouette reads as a small reaper — compact but deeply unsettling. Limited color palette using bright gold, dark amber, burnt yellow, bone white, black shadows, faint sickly green for miasma accents. Clean readable silhouette, no anti-aliasing, retro 16-bit style pixel art on transparent background.

### Modifiers

- **Spritesheet:** Gliding movement cycle 4-frames with trailing cloth animation, miasma particles shifting each frame, 8-direction facing, organized grid layout
- **More menace:** Mask has a single hairline crack running diagonally across, one eye socket glows brighter than the other, asymmetric unsettling presence
- **Solarpunk aesthetic:** Solarpunk world corruption, nature reclaimed by death, warm gold tones contrasting with sickly green poison, fits jungle arena setting as an unnatural invader
